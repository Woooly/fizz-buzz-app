# Fizz Buzz

Fizz Buzz is a classic children's word game that teaches division and is often used as a technical interview question. This project implements the Fizz Buzz game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a modern and elegant design.

## How It Works

The game counts from 1 to a given number:
- If the number is a multiple of 3, it displays "Fizz".
- If the number is a multiple of 5, it displays "Buzz".
- If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, it displays "FizzBuzz".

For example, the output for numbers 1 through 15 is:
```
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
```
